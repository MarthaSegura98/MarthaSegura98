## Hi there 👋
- 🔭 I’m currently working on Ascires Grupo Médico
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Big Data & Cloud

🗣️Hi! I’m passionate about communication, technology, and data. I have experience in content management and coordinating small projects, and I’m especially drawn to social and healthcare initiatives with a humanitarian purpose.

☁️📊 I’ve always loved communicating and exploring how technology and data can make a difference—this is why I’m currently building skills in Big Data and Cloud, aiming to combine my communication experience with data-driven insights.

🤝🎯 Before stepping into corporate communication, I worked at Inditex for four years while completing my degree. That experience taught me resilience, teamwork, and how to solve problems with a customer-focused approach—skills I carry into every project I take on.

🚀I’m excited about opportunities that bring together content, projects, and technology, where I can contribute meaningfully while continuing to grow in the data and cloud field.
